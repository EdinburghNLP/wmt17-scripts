# THE UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH'S WMT17 SYSTEMS
-------------------------------------------

This directory contains some of the University of Edinburgh's
submissions to the WMT17 shared translation task, and a 'training'
directory with scripts to preprocess and train your own model.

If you are accessing this through a git repository, it will contain all scripts and documentation,
but no model files - the models are accessible at http://data.statmt.org/wmt17_systems
