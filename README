This directory contains some of the University of Edinburgh's submissions to the WMT17 shared translation task.
To use, download the files of the respective language pair's directory, plus the 'scripts' directory and 'vars' file.
You will be required to install or download some toolkits, and point to their location in the 'vars' file.

Finally, you can translate from standard input with the scripts {src}-{trg}/translate-*.sh .
We provide different configurations for translation with a single model, an ensemble of models,
or for reranking with right-to-left models. The latter is our best model, and may vary slightly from the official
submission system - see the shared task description for more details.
