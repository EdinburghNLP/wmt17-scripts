WMT17 TRAINING SCRIPTS
----------------------

We used various different approaches for preprocessing
and data augmentation for monolingual data for different
languages. Check the system description for more detail.

In this directory, we provide a sample configuration for
preprocessing and training for English->German. Please note
that this script will not reproduce our WMT17 results, which also
rely on the use of back-translated monolingual data, and
combination of multiple models. Please also have a look at last year's
accompanying scripts and sample configurations; among others,
there is documentation for right-to-left reranking:
